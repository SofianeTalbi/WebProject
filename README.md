Projet Web Project
=======
Context
----------
link to my project: https://github.com/SofianeTalbi/WebProject.git

As part of the Web project course, I had to develop a social web application “OpenEvents” where users can manage, search and participate in events of any field. As a social app, users needed to interact with each other by becoming friends and communicating within the platform. Having had problems with my registration, I started the project late and I could not integrate a team of 4 students. So I did this project on my own.

Analysis report
----------
*Conclusion*

After working on this social network project with Vue.js, I developed a passion for creating interactive web applications. By carrying out this project, I had the opportunity to acquire new programming skills and to familiarize myself with the different functionalities of Vue.js. Also, I did this project on my own. The process of designing, developing, and implementing the social networking application gave me hands-on experience of how web applications are built in the real world. I also learned how to handle the technical challenges that arise when building a complex application. Overall, I really enjoyed working on this project and discovered a passion for creating web applications. I'm quite proud of the end result and excited to continue learning and developing exciting web applications in the future.

*Axes of development*

One of the axes of improvement would be to add the functionalities that I would have had to do if I had been in a group such as managing friendships, the timeline of events attended and the conversation Management.
